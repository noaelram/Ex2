# The Maze Of Waze

This repository is about developing a weighted, deliberate graph data structure: after implementing a number of algorithms on this data structure, such as calculating a short path, checking connectivity, calculating the length of the shortest path between two nodes and more, we can represent a graphical interface, that can represent a graph, save it, run algorithms on it - and show the results.
